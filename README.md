Run Admissible.m to compute an admissible set using sample data from a linear system. Only works with bump.

Run Invariant.m to compute a positive invariant set for an underdamped system. Works with most RBF types. Comparison with the model-based maximum positive invariant set: Model_PI_set.

Run Julia.m to iteratively compute a positive invariant set for the Julia map, a chaotic system. Comparison with MPI_Julia_True.
