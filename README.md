Admissible.m computes an admissible set using sample data from a linear system. Only works with bump.

Invariant.m computes four positive invariant sets for an underdamped system. Works with most RBF types. Comparison with the model-based maximum positive invariant set: Model_PI_set.

Julia.m iteratively computes a positive invariant set for the Julia map, a chaotic system. Comparison with MPI_Julia_True.
